# Elan Formation Exercise

## OOP Cinema

### What I learned:

- To Use the standard format of date in "DateTime(yyyy-mm-dd)"

- To simulaneously add value in two arrays of two classes, by setting a method in one of the classes - between "Acteur" and "Role"(it's commented because I found a way to link three classes which is more useful) - . 
 
- To link three classes ("Film", "Acteur" and "Role") in a new class ("Casting") by
creating an array in each three classes and adding value by "Casting"'s new object.
